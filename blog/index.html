                <p>I'm a firm believer that the only way to really appreciate a new location is to stay just a little longer than you think you should. For most travel sites, the recommended length of stay in ho chi minh is only 2 days, but I had a good feeling about it and my boyfriend and I stayed for five whole days and left in the early morning of the sixth.
                <br /><br />
                    Weeks later, we reminisce on Ho Chi Minh or, as we fondly refer to it, Saigon. Even during the trip, we couldn't quite believe how much we enjoyed every bit of it - from the landmarks and the activities to the food and the people. 
                <br /><br />
                We had learned from our previous trips to take advantage of the first day and to absorb the place as soon as we could. After leaving our things at the hotel, we threw ourselves at the city, immediately met with the culture shock of cars and motors coming from every direction. What they say is true - to cross the street, all you have to do is close your eyes and wish for the best. 
                <br /><br />
                         
                On our first full day in Ho Chi Minh, we decided to dive into the city's history by visiting the War Remnants Museum. The museum offered a deeply moving and intense look into the Vietnam War, presenting an unfiltered perspective of the conflict through photographs, military equipment, and personal stories. We walked through each exhibit, feeling a range of emotions from sorrow to amazement at the resilience of the Vietnamese people. It was a stark reminder of the past that shaped the nation and its people. Despite the heavy subject matter, the museum staff were incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable, eager to share their insights and answer our questions. This visit set the tone for our trip, grounding us in the rich and complex history of Vietnam. Frequently, my boyfriend and I would talk about how the Vietnamese people survived and struggled through the war and how they rebuilt their country.

                The second day was a complete change of pace as we embarked on a tour of the Mekong River. The journey began with a scenic bus ride through the countryside, offering glimpses of lush green fields and quaint villages. Once we arrived at the river, we boarded a small boat and drifted along the water, surrounded by towering coconut trees and vibrant floating markets. The guide explained the significance of the Mekong Delta to the local economy and culture. We stopped at a small island where we sampled exotic fruits and witnessed traditional music performances. The highlight of the day was a peaceful paddle through the narrow canals, where the only sounds were the gentle splash of the oars and the chirping of birds. It was a serene escape from the bustling city, and we returned to our hotel feeling refreshed and inspired.
                <br /><br />
                    
                Day three was a culinary adventure as we joined a Vietnamese cooking class. We learned to prepare sour soup with prawn, lotus stem salad, and claypot stewed chicken with ginger. The hands-on experience was both educational and fun, and we enjoyed the fruits of our labor by feasting on the delicious dishes we had created. Our instructor was patient and enthusiastic, sharing not only cooking techniques but also stories about Vietnamese culture and traditions. She even shared that she's gone to the Philippines and has tried our bulalo! 
                <br /><br />
                    
                On the fourth day, we visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, an elaborate underground network used by Viet Cong soldiers during the Vietnam War. The tour was extremely humbling as we crawled through the narrow, dark tunnels, gaining a first-hand understanding of the conditions soldiers endured. It was hot, dark, and cramped. Our guide told us all about the tales of survival and the harsh realities of wartime life. The surrounding jungle and booby traps added to the immersive experience, making it a day we wouldn't soon forget. This visit was another powerful reminder of the resilience and resourcefulness of the Vietnamese people, and it left us with a profound respect for their history and struggle.

                Our final full day in Ho Chi Minh was spent exploring the city's rich coffee culture. We signed up for a coffee-making class, eager to learn about one of Vietnam's most famous exports. The class took place in a charming caf√©, where a barista guided us through the process of selecting beans, roasting, and brewing. We discovered the nuances of Vietnamese coffee, from the robusta beans to the iconic phin filter method. Tasting different brews, including the famous egg coffee, was a highlight. The class was not only informative but also a delightful way to spend our last day in the city. We left with a newfound appreciation for Vietnamese coffee and a few bags of beans to bring a taste of Saigon back home with us.

                Reflecting on our trip, we couldn't help but feel grateful for the kindness and hospitality we encountered throughout our stay. Both the locals and fellow tourists were consistently polite and friendly, offering help whenever we needed it and making sure we felt comfortable and welcomed. From the bustling streets of the city to the tranquil waters of the Mekong, their warmth and generosity made our experience in Ho Chi Minh truly unforgettable. As we boarded our flight, we left with hearts full of memories and a promise to return to this captivating city.
